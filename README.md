# Simple React Form

This is a user registration form with three steps: 

1. User identity 
2. User address
3. User description

After all three steps are completed, the user can see some data at a confirmation page.

## About
The form doesn't have a communication with an API. The framework used was Next.js alongside with TailwindCSS for styling, futhermore, Typescript was used for better development experience.

All form inputs have validation (react-hook-form + yup). And ContextAPI was used to manage the data between the steps, and for the dark mode.
